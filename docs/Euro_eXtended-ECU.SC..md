### The ENZYM Symbiose between the old SI-prefixes and the new qQ-prefixes 

#### The 4 Facts came from/a zero & with E from 1 to 2 to 3 coherent with 3 to 6 to 9 as PZQQET.rfof conforms

##### The 5. Dimension is a parallel/mirror interlocking new creation

###### The sixth fact It always arises from the process and is like a new zero point.

####### The seventh dimension (7D) is the second of the third dimension from 1, 2, 3, to 3, 6, 9, with 0=E and parallel=mirror as well as SI-/qQ=entangled. What does it mean that 5D must be a supra-entanglement leading to 8D? 

######## What does this mean? The 8th dimension, thus the superposition of one and/or more superconductors/semiconductors, was first demonstrated by Justin Koch in 2023 via his PZqQET.rfof that the 7th dimension is the parity of all other processes, not quite all other dimensions, but thus the 8th dimension is a qubit, or the qubits are.

######### The 9th dimension is the axiom of all processes and dimensions, namely as ORB; this ORB is thus q and the BEGINNING of the process.

########## The 1+9(=[1]*{3}*0) ORB of Q, consisting of 2 digits, is the END ORB and connects every process, every dimension, and thus every linearity as/via SupraParity with the BEGINNER ORB q.

# Euro eXtended ECU-SC is the new Trash TO Cash supraNECsystem that implements paper ECU SI prefixes, security versions as bits encoding €ORBIT(Orbit) bytes, based on the qEuekta QuEtta. PZqQET Axiometix-/Axiomatic

####### Thus, the old value of the ECU can serve as the basis for the bits of the new (€ORBIT/Orbit) Internet #BitcoinInternet, secured and monitored by/through the EU's AIDA Special Committee, while simultaneously supporting networks like Eliminating the darknet and other insecure networks, as well as preventing data from leaving the ColdNet and entering the WarmNet, thus avoiding the risk of it ending up in such insecure networks, is recycled into real value in €ECU. So that the user's frontend and storage still contain everything as they selected; whether they delete data has no effect on recycling, and vice versa. #PZQQET.rfof









## summary

# QUOTE [Dr. med. Norbert Ostendorf](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Unit#:~:text=Definition,Einheit%20der%20Enzymaktivit%C3%A4t%20ist%20Katal.): 
The unit is a unit of measurement for enzyme activity. This refers to the amount of enzyme that converts one micromole of substrate per minute.

Since enzymes are usually measured in solutions, the standard unit of measurement is Units per Liter (U/L).

The SI unit of enzyme activity is katal.
